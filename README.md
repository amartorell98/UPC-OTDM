# Optimization Techniques for Data Mining
Collection of the 3 projects developed for this elective course at the UPC (https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/curriculum/syllabus/OTDM-MIRI). Code is in Matlab (Deliverable 1), AMPL (Deliverable 2 and 3) and Python (Deliverable 3).


1.  Pattern Recognition with Single Layer Neural Network (Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization): A single layer NN can be formulated as an unconstrained non linear optimization problem. In this project, we minimize the Loss function using three optimization algorithms: Gradient method, Quasi Newton method, Stochastic gradient deseent method.

2.  Implementation of the SVM Primal and Dual Optimization Problems (Constrained Nonlinear Optimization). In collaboration with @PimSchoolkateUPC

3.  Cluster median problem formulated as an interger opimization problem. An heuristic solution using minimum spanning tree is also presented. In collaboration with @eReverter
